- How to write to that file
- The syntax needed to complete these operations
- How to format code to be functional
- Adding in try function

## Tasks
- Read from a txt list file and create a document that reads names and dates of birth and displays them in two lists: Names and Date of Birth
- Create a program that writes to a txt file students that need to be registered along with their student id numbers

## Instruction on how to use the code

- Dob task takes takes information from a file and reads this information
returning a list of names and followed by dates of birth
- Student reg task asks user how many students they would like to register
and then their names and student id. These details are then written to the student registry
